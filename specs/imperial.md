## Special

### Death Star III
* Cost: 18,000 KCs
* Production Time: 180 Days
* Diameter: 16 kilometers
* Hyperdrive: x7
* Shields: 16,000
* Armor: 8,000
* Hull: 8,000
* Systems: 8,000
* Speed: Orbital (1)
* Maneuver: Rotational (0)

Weapons:
* 1000 Turbolaser Cannons (8000)
* 100 Tractor Beam Projectors (10km)
* 1 Mark-III Superlaser (10,000)


Onboard Units:
* 72 TIE Starfighter Squadrons
* 144 Auxiliary Craft
* 1600 Imperial Fleet Trooper Squads (Crew)
* 3200 Stormtrooper Squads (Security)


Notes: The Death Star III is an ambitious attempt to recreate one of the galaxy's most feared superweapons in a smaller and more capable package. Designed to be a "pocket Death Star" from the very beginning, the Death Star III is only 1/10th the diameter of the original Death Star. While the Death Star III is not capable of destroying a planet with the Mark-III Superlaser, it is a powerful space-to-surface weapon that if fired from the A-Ring to an adjacent G-Grid Space, will completely destroy all units in that space and permanently convert the terrain to a Wasteland (aka "Base Delta Zero"). The Mark-III Superlaser may also be fired at capital ships 1 grid space away. The Mark-III Superlaser requires a full 48 hours to recharge after each shot.

### Imperial Fleet Trooper Squad
* Unit Cost: FREE
* Production Time: 14 Days
* UCR: 5
* Hit Points: 6
* Attack Rating: 3

Notes: Stock Ground Infantry for all starships and facilities; free cost is offset by lengthy production time. Fleet Troopers are also trained in a specific job regarding starship operations, and so while they are more than capable of engaging in full-scale ground combat, these troopers would prefer to stand watch on facilities and starships as sentries and crewmen.

* Production Time: 7 Days
* UCR: 6
* Hit Points: 7
* Attack Rating: 4

Army Troopers wear green fatigues with open-face plastoid helmets and breastplates.

### Imperial Stormtrooper Squad
* Unit Cost: 3 KCs
* Production Time: 14 Days
* UCR: 6
* Hit Points: 8

They feature an impressive sensor jamming suite capable of deflecting any passive or active ComScan sweeps. Does not count against a player's Command Point Capacity and also can be stowed aboard any ship due to multi-purpose airlock tubes (for ships that don't have onboard unit capacity).

If * making a run for a Deep Space Zone, please be advised of its x30 Hyperdrive.
