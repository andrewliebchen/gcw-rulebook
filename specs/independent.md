## Capital Ships

### Venator Star Destroyer (VNSD)
Cost: 1400 KCs
Production Time: 14 Days
Length: 1140 meters
Hyperdrive: x1
Shields: 1140
Armor: 1140
Hull: 640
Systems: 640
Speed: Slow (1)
Maneuver: (2)
Weapons:
10 Dual Heavy Turbolaser Cannons (200)
50 Heavy Laser Cannons (100)
Onboard Units:
8 Starfighter Squadrons
30 Auxiliary Craft
500 Infantry Squads
Notes: Capable of entering the atmosphere and making planetary landings.
Background: The Venator-class achieved much success during the onset of the Galactic Empire, but as more Victory-class and Imperial-class Star Destroyers were produced, the Tarkin Doctrine made the Venator-class obsolete and as such many were scrapped, sold, or mothballed.  Although this class of ship is available through Black Market Shipyards, the upgrades (both internal and external) to modernize its functionality were costly - resulting in a ship with far less support craft capacity than its Clone Wars ancestors were capable of.



### Providence Battlecruiser (PBC)
Cost: 1200 KCs
Production Time: 12 Days
Length: 1100 meters
Hyperdrive: x2
Shields: 1100
Armor: 1100
Hull: 650
Systems: 650
Speed: Slow (1)
Maneuver: (2)
Weapons:
10 Heavy Quad Turbolaser Cannons (400)
40 Quad Laser Cannons (160)
80 Proton Torpedo Launchers (240)
Onboard Units:
2 Starfighter Squadrons
2 Auxiliary Craft
Notes: Capable of entering the atmosphere and making planetary landings.
Background: As one of the prevalent ships-of-the-line for Separatist forces during the Clone Wars, the Providence-class became respected by the Republic due to its heavy firepower which was capable of standing up against Venator or Victory-class Destroyers.  As a result of the dramatic and rapid ending of the Clone Wars, a vast number of these ships fell into private hands, disarray, and subsequent reselling to various parties.


### Dreadnaught Heavy Cruiser (DREAD)
Cost: 900 KCs
Production Time: 9 Days
Length: 700 meters
Hyperdrive: x2
Shields: 700
Armor: 700
Hull: 700
Systems: 350
Speed: Slow (1)
Maneuver: (2)
Weapons:
50 Heavy Turbolaser Cannons (500)
1 Tractor Beam Projector (100m)
Onboard Units:
3 Starfighter Squadrons
500 Infantry Squads
Notes: Can enter atmosphere and make planetary landings. These independently used Dreadnaughts are the streamlined and powerful versions of their Imperial or Republic counterparts, as they feature nothing but heavy turbolaser cannons for their weapon emplacements - making them ideal for ship-to-ship combat. With an assault-ready contingent of ground troops and starfighters as well, these ships easily outclass other vessels. (Although having access to Independent tech, Imperial Remnant and Rebel Alliance players cannot build this ship - as they have their own faction's Dreadnaught).


### Hammerhead Escort Frigate (HEF)
Cost: 400 KCs
Production Time: 4 Days
Length: 315 meters
Hyperdrive: x2
Shields: 315
Armor: 315

12 Ion Cannons (36)
2 Concussion Missile Launchers (4)
1 Tractor Beam Projector (100m)
Onboard Craft:
3 Starfighter Squadrons
2 Auxiliary Craft
40 Infantry Squads
Notes: Capable of entering the atmosphere and performing planetary landings.
Background: The Hammerhead-class is one of the most enduring warships to have served in the galaxy, much like its peer - the Dreadnaught.  Despite being an aged design, contemporary versions of the vessel are still being produced today for private buyers due to their flexibility and popularity.

### Marauder Corvette (MARC)
Cost: 200 KCs
Production Time: 2 Days
Length: 195 meters
Hyperdrive: x2
Shields: 195
Armor: 195
Hull: 100
Systems: 100
Speed: Fast (2)
Maneuver: (3)
Weapons:
8 Dual Turbolaser Cannons (96)
4 Proton Torpedo Launchers (12)
Onboard Units:
1 Starfighter Squadrons
2 Auxiliary Craft
8 Infantry Squads
Background: Although intended to be a multi-platform patrol ship, Republic Seinar Systems had difficulties selling these ships to the Republic due to its inefficient bureaucracy.  These vessels were then produced for numerous parties, most notably the Corporate Sector Authority, where they find use as patrol and interdiction vessels.


### Action VI Gunship (AVIG)
Cost: 150 KCs
Production Time: 1 Day
Length: 150 meters
Hyperdrive: x2
Shields: 150
Armor: 150
Hull: 150
Systems: 75
Speed: Fast (2)
Maneuver: (3)
Weapons:
6 Turbolaser Cannons (48)
6 Proton Torpedo Launchers (18)
6 Quad Laser Cannons (24)
6 Ion Cannons (12)
Notes: With uncertain times, many private merchant and government shipping fleets alike have flocked to the Corellian Engineering Corporation to have them manufacture bulk cruisers than can act as convoy escorts without standing out as one.


### Charger Consular Cruiser (CCC)
Cost: FREE
Production Time: 7 Days
Command Points: 1
Length: 115 meters
Hyperdrive: x2
Shields: 115
Armor: 115
Hull: 60
Systems: 60
Speed: Fast (2)
Maneuver: (4)
Weapons:
5 Dual Turbolaser Cannons (80)
2 Quad Laser Cannons (8)
Onboard Units:
5 Infantry Squads
Notes: Capable of entering the atmosphere and making planetary landings.
Background: Stock Capital Ship for independent forces to be used as PDF or Fleet support; free cost is offset by extended production time. During the Clone Wars, Consular-class Cruisers were extremely  versatile and as such took on a variety of roles: escort, courier, patrol, cruiser, frigate, and attack ship. To boost their combat effectiveness the Corellian Engineering Company issued the Charger C70 refit, which enabled the Republic to deploy them on more military missions.  After the Clone Wars, the Galactic Empire moved to disassociate itself from this particular class due to its connections with the Jedi Order, so many of them were sold to private hands.


### Delta Star Cruiser (DSC)
Cost: 250 KCs
Production Time: 3 Days
Length: 100 meters
Hyperdrive: x0.75
Shields: 100
Armor: 100
Systems: 50
Speed: Slow (1)

Weapons:
1 Quad Laser Cannon (4)
Onboard Units:
10 Infantry Squads
5 GAVs
2 Auxiliary Craft
Capabilities:
1. Landing Capability (this unit can perform planetary landings).
2. Special Conversion (This unit can be permanently converted into a Delta-class Multipurpose Base for FREE while on the ground, this process takes 3 Days).
Notes: The Delta-class Star Cruiser is a popular vessel used by explorers and conquerors alike because of its ability to be broken down and rebuilt into a Delta-class ground facility for basic support operations. Veteran settlers have nicknamed these ships "flying repair parts" simply because every component can be stripped and reused for something else.

Desiring to boost performance, Elite Z-95s are the preferred starfighter among private military contractors or in fringe communities, as the numerous commercially available off-the-shelf upgrades for the basic Z-95 have all been rolled together into one package for robust enhancements that speak for themselves.

## Ground Units

### Paramilitary Trooper Squad
Unit Cost: 0 KCs
Production Time: 0 Days
UCR: 3
Hit Points: 4
Attack Rating: 3
Notes: Paramilitary Troopers are essentially combat personnel who have been given a crash course in military fighting techniques and basic weapons familiarization, and so while they lack the organization, discipline, and effectiveness of more elite and better equipped soldiers, they make up for this in their dedication and fighting spirit. Paramilitary Troopers do not require a facility to be trained at, and so they can be recruited anywhere at anytime by a host faction. Takes no UCR penalties from terrain due to planetary familiarity if defending a host world.


### Army/Navy Trooper Squad
Unit Cost: FREE
Production Time: 7 Days
UCR: 4
Hit Points: 5
Attack Rating: 3
Notes: These are the Stock Infantry Units for all Independent capital ships and facilities; free cost is offset by extended training time. Army/Navy Troopers (ANTs) are the most basic of the regular and conventionally trained infantry that make up the bulk of multi-mission combat forces in the galaxy.


### Private Military Contractor Squad
Unit Cost: 7 KCs
Production Time: 1 Day
UCR: 6
Hit Points: 10
Attack Rating: 5
Notes: Uncertain times often call for unconventionality, and so commanders looking to improve the combat effectiveness of their ground contingency have relied on mercenaries since the beginning of warfare. Private Military Contractors, who typically are Mandalorian, rely on advanced combat techniques and weapons in order to give them a unique edge in battle.


### Speeder Bike (BIKE)
Unit Cost: FREE
Production Time: 7 Days
UCR: 10
Hit Points: 10
Attack Rating: 10
Notes: Stock GAV available to all factions (even one's without access to Indy tech); free cost is offset by extended production time.


### T-16 Combat Skyhopper (T-16)
Unit Cost: 20 KCs
Production Time: 7 Days
UCR: 6
Hit Points: 40
Attack Rating: 20
Notes: Incom's T-16 model is both a favorite for civilian and military pilots alike, due to its conventionality and ability to upgrade for combat purposes.


### T4-B "Titan" Heavy Tank (T4-B)
Unit Cost: 60 KCs
Production Time: 7 Days
UCR: 6
Hit Points: 120
Attack Rating: 60
Notes: Although popular with Rebel forces, the "Titan" is as equally proliferated throughout the galaxy as a viable heavy vehicle suitable for both assault and defense.

Onboard Unit Capacity:
10 Infantry Squads
5 GAVs
2 Auxiliary Craft
Special Capabilities:
1. HyperComm-I Transceiver (may send messages at x1 hyperspeed).
2. COTS ComScan (capable of PASSIVE scanning up to the A-Ring).
3. Low-Profile (Invisible to PASSIVE scanning, until units are deployed)
4. Trade Center (Industrial Output of 25 KCs each Action Day).
Notes: The Delta-class Base is the most basic of ground facilities that has found widespread use on just about every planet in the galaxy due to its A-frame construction design and proliferation of standardized building materials. It allows everybody - from explorers, fringe communities, frontiersmen, and military commanders - to establish presence on a world with little expense and risk. Because of their small stature, they have low-recognition on sensors and have the bonus of being invisible to passive scanning. The facility also comes with a Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) ComScan sensor suite to detect vessels in orbit. Can be built without an Alpha-class Facility present in the same system.

Notes: In GCW - Episode I: Ashes of the Alliance, a popular feature of the game was the venerable "auxiliary facility", well now I am excited to bring back these aux facilities into Twilight of the Empire. Like before, aux facilities are modular add-ons to existing facilities that increase that facility's capabilities. No more than (1) aux facility can be attached at any given time, and no more than (4) total aux facilities can be built on any given planet.

## Third Party Tech

OUTER RIM COALITION
The ORC is a loosely-organized crime syndicate that uses official business ties, smugglers, pirates, and a guild of bounty hunters and spies to make money and take advantage of intergalactic unrest. While there is no honor among thieves, the ORC uses militaristic structuring to maintain order onboard its ships and between newcomers and veterans or those simply looking to temporarily join an expedition to make a quick cred. Independent players have access to this tech if their player is aligned to one of the above mentioned professions, but for the most part these units will be used for NPC purposes.

Notes: This ship is a mass-production version of Boba Fett's famed Slave I, as the ORC Research, Engineering, and Development ("RED") Company attempted to recreate every modification Boba Fett made on his prototype Firespray. While sluggish and lacking sufficient shields and armor for prolonged combat, the FAS is capable of deploying the powerful Krupx Void-7 Seismic Charge to great effect.


### ORC Space Marine
Cost: 7 KCs
Production Time: 1 Day
UCR: 12
Armor: 12
Attack Rating: 12
Notes: The Outer Rim Coalition's infamous reputation has come mainly from the powerful and elite Space Marine Corps. By and large, the Space Marines employ powered battlesuits capable of withstanding Zero-G and Vacuum environments, as well as extremely powerful and illegal weapons not available to conventional infantry. As such, these fearsome warriors can only be used in boarding operations or when repelling borders of their own starships or space facilities.

#### NABOO ROYAL ARMED FORCES
Notes: After the assassination of Queen Apailana during the Galactic Civil War, the Royal Naboo Security Forces met their final demise battling the Galactic Empire for control of Theed. Naboo, which is now considered a broken state, has reorganized a new fighting force to combat the threats of the galaxy and restore order to the planet. NRAF units will be used as stock concerning Naboo battles.

## Hero Units

### INDEPENDENT FREELANCER
Unit Cost: 2000 KC
Production Time: 7 Days
UCR: 10
Armor: 200
Hit Points: 200
Attack: 200
Upgrade Cost: 1000 KCs
Notes: This unit does not "Level Up" like the other Hero Units, instead, a new capability is added to his skillset as part of the overall character's abilities. Freelancers begin the game as a Fringer +1 other Capability. Freelancers do not get Command Points or a "Paycheck" like other Heroes (both Independent or Faction) and so all of their earnings must be made using their capabilities. Freelancers begin the game with 1000 KCs in their bank account.
Capabilities:
1. FRINGER -- You get 250 KCs to create a custom freighter/auxiliary ship that also has a Sensor Jammer for STEALTH (invisbility to PASSIVE/ACTIVE ComScan). This  craft (for purposes of other capabilities) will be referred to as the Hero's Ship.
2. SMUGGLER -- Your Hero's Ship gains 100 Cargo Units to perform SMUGGLING RUNS. To initiate a Smuggling Run, begin at Tatooine and load your ship with "Merchandise Units" (cargo, contraband, gear, etc). Merchandise Units cost 1 KC each, and can be delivered to a player controlled Stronghold world and sold for 3 KCs each. Other players can invest in a smuggler and pay him for his services to obtain extra income. To do this, players can purchase Merchandise Units for 1 KC each, and then once the Smuggler arrives at their Stronghold (or another planet base) to sell the Merchandise for 3 KCs, the Player gets 2 KCs and the Smuggler gets 1 KC per unit as his "cut". This can be an easy way for the Smuggler to make money without buying Merch and for Players to make some extra money on the side too. ONE LAST NOTE: While a smuggler has his ship loaded out, he looses all STEALTH capability.
3. BOUNTY HUNTER -- +1 UCR, +300 Armor, Hit Points, and Attack. If this Freelancer kills or captures another Hero, he immediately gets paid 3000 KCs from the Hutt Syndicate. The Hero's Ship also comes equipped with a TRACKING DEVICE which can launch HOMING BEACONS onto target ships (once per battle). Homing Beacon launches are undetectable (so players can't post knowledge of them or remove them), but expire after the ship makes 2 hyperspace jumps. Destinations of the jumps must be sent to the Bounty Hunter via private message. Bounty Hunters en route to a HOMING BEACON travel at half time.
4. MERCENARY -- +100 Armor, Hit Points, and Attack. This Freelancer can command (while onboard the Hero's Ship) a "Mercenary Strike Force" which can be a Fleet Escort Group of up to 3 Starfighter Squadrons (from any faction's tech) and up to 12 Auxiliary Craft (from any faction's tech) OR One "Fringer Ship" (from any tech) not to exceed 5 Command Points. Units comprising the Mercenary Strike Force must be purchased at normal cost (either by the Freelancer himself or the faction that hires him). Mercenaries can contract their work out to players at agreed upon rates. Private Military Contractor Squads for this Freelancer cost -2 KCs.
5. CEO -- This Freelancer gains an Industrial Output of 500 KCs by virtue of running his own networked operation.
6. PIRATE -- This Freelancer gains +5 Command Points that can be used towards the command of any number of capital ships. (If combined with the Mercenary ability, the Freelancer would have 10 CPs total). For each capital ship that this Freelancer destroys in battle, he earns 1 KC for each 1 meter of its length. Salvaged ships yield full cost (instead of the normal half).
7. REVOLUTIONARY -- This Freelancer can travel to any world and recruit 50 Paramilitary Trooper Squads per day as part of a "Revolutionary Underground Force" (RUF) that is undetectable. RUFs that exceed 1500 Squads are immediately detected and must launch an immediate ground battle with the PDF. If the Freelancer leaves the planet, the RUF looses troops at a rate of -50 Squads/day. If a planet is already captured or under control, then the Revolutionary can immediately recruit 2000 Paramilitary Trooper Squads as part of a "Paramilitary Army Corps" that can provide permanent standing defenses (without ground facility support) while the Revolutionary is on-planet; if the Revolutionary leaves the planet, the Army Corps is disbanded.
8. LEGEND -- (Learning this skill requires 2000 KC) If this Freelancer has 5 other abilities acquired (excluding the "Fringer" ability), then he may assume any prestige title of the player's choosing. The Freelancer's Command Point capacity is immediately raised to (and capped off at) 23 CPs, and his personal Industrial Output is raised to 1000 KCs/Action Day.


#### INDEPENDENT SMUGGLER
To Hire Unit: 400 KCs/Action Day
UCR: 10
Armor: 200
Hit Points: 200
Attack: 200
Capabilities: The Independent Smuggler can be hired as a player-controlled Mini-Hero unit that can perform SMUGGLING RUNS for the player and operate independently of any fleet (since the Smuggler is under contract, he does not get a "cut"). Players must go to either Tatooine or a planet with "Smuggling Operations" to recruit a Smuggler. As a special ability of the Hutt Syndicate: any player (including HS players) can go to Nal Hutta & Nar Shaddaa to hire the Smuggler at a discount by paying the Hutt Syndicate 200 KCs/Action Day instead of the normal 400 KCs required (HS Players will just pay 200 KCs/Action Day out of pocket).

Hyperdrive: x30
Shields: 100
Armor: 100
Systems: 100
Speed: Fast (2)
Maneuver: (3)
Elite UCR Bonus: +10
Capabilities: Each Hero gets (1) of these units for free (additional ones must be purchased normally). They are one-time use units that can transport a Hero to a nearby location. They ignore movement restrictions when moving across the Space grid (from ring-to-ring to atmosphere or vice versa), and due to their small size, they are tractor beam resistant. If making a run for the planet, enemy forces CAN (and probably will) try to shoot this unit down, if so, be advised of its UCR of 15, as well as the risk of potentially having your Hero Unit killed. If making a run for a Deep Space Zone, please be advised of its x30 Hyperdrive.

## Trade Federation Tech

#### TRADE FEDERATION
Notes: The resurrected Trade Federation is a galaxy-wide faction that has no true Stronghold to call headquarters. Instead, the Trade Federation deploys its Fleet to enforce, regulate, or muscle out competitors in order to expand their free trade franchise. Players that choose to command the Trade Federation can only build the technology listed below.

### Dauntless Heavy Cruiser (DHC)

20 Vulture Droid Starfighter Squadrons
12 Falcon Droid Recon Starfighters
30 Multi-Troop Transports
30 Trade Federation Dropships
300 Armored Assault Tanks
3000 Battle Droid Squads
Notes: With the galaxy in pieces, many factions that once held power are resurrecting once again as viable threats. A resurrected Trade Federation, now under new management, has made a contract with SoroSuub to produce the Dauntless-class as their ship-of-the-line and droid carrier. Designed to be a standalone warship, the Dauntless is capable of engaging entire fleets and planets by itself.

### Trade Federation Dreadnaught (DREAD)
Cost: 800 KCs
Production Time: 8 Days
Length: 700 meters
Hyperdrive: x1
Shields: 700
Armor: 700

Speed: Fast (2)
Maneuver: (1)

Onboard Units:
6 Vulture Droid Starfighter Squadrons
10 Multi-Troop Transports
400 Battle Droid Squads
20 Armored Assault Tanks
Notes: Capable of entering the atmosphere and making planetary landings. | Background: In order to have a more capable fleet that could easily be distributed throughout the galaxy for patrols and security, the Trade Federation tasked SoroSuub to build them their own Dreadnaught variant as a sister-ship to the Dauntless-class, which would be just as capable of supporting Trade Federation droid technology. Considering only the command staff is human, the rest of the crew is comprised of droids and automated systems, which meant more of the internal rigging became dedicated to large hangar bays and a more powerful engine.

### Trade Federation Action VI Transport (AVIT)
Cost: FREE
Production Time: 7 Days
Command Points: 1
Length: 150 meters
Hyperdrive: x1
Shields: 150

6 Dual Ion Cannons (36)
1 Tractor Beam Projector (100m)
Onboard Units:
1 Vulture Droid Starfighter Squadron
Notes: Capable of entering the atmosphere and making planetary landings. | Background: This is the work horse of the Trade Federation, as it mules cargo and supplies from one end of the galaxy to the other; as well as supports the Dreadnaught for planetary defense. As a stock capital ship for the Trade Federation, its free cost is offset by the long production time.

Shields: 100
Armor: 100

Hyperdrive: None
Shields: None
Armor: 144
Speed: Fast (2)
Maneuver: (2)
Weapons:
48 Laser Cannons (48)

### Condor Droid Bomber Squadron (C/DB)
Cost: 40 KCs
Production Time: 1 Day
Length: 4 meters
Hyperdrive: None
Shields: None
Armor: 144
Speed: Slow (1)

Weapons:
24 Proton Torpedo Launchers (72)
Notes: Can be switched out to replace Vulture Droids (after purchase). While Vultures have laser cannons, Condors feature proton torpedoes for heavier strike packages and proton torpedoes for atmospheric bombing runs, although their slow speed only makes them effective against all but the largest capital ships.

### Falcon Droid Recon Starfighter (F/DR)

Length: 4 meters
Hyperdrive: x1
Shields: 8
Armor: 8

Notes: Available to all players. This SoroSuub designed craft uses the same Vulture Droid Starfighter platform but is redesigned to provide basic TeleComScan capabilities. Can be interchanged onboard capital ships and facilities with auxiliary craft on a 1:1 basis, as it requires additional onboard computer equipment to support it.

Attack Rating: 4
Notes: Modeled after the famous B2 Super Battle Droids of the Separatist Armies, advancements in droid combat technology have grown leaps and bounds since the glory days of the Clone Wars, with these modern B3 super battle droids being on par with light combat infantry and capable of conquering worlds relying on conventional defenses.

### Trade Federation Legionnaire Squad
Unit Cost: 5 KCs
Production Time: 14 Days
UCR: 7
Hit Points: 9
Attack Rating: 5
Notes: Replaces (3) Battle Droid Squads where stationed.
Background: The Trade Federation Legion is the only "organic" fighting force the Trade Federation employs. These elite troopers are comprised of volunteers from anywhere and everywhere. With a "no questions asked" recruiting policy, Trade Federation Legionnaires begin their service with a blank record and an entirely new name if they so choose, and so many wandering souls, rogue spacers, fringers, ex-convicts, war criminals, fugitives, or just plain people join the Legion hoping to turn their life around and make a career for themselves. Upon completing an initial 5 year enlistment, Legionnaires obtain immediate citizenship in the Trade Federation as well as an opportunity enter the Trade Federation Merchant Marine Academy to become a Fleet Officer.

### Single Trooper Aerial Platform (STAP)
Unit Cost: FREE
Production Time: 7 Days
UCR: 10
Hit Points: 10

## Hapes Consortium Tech

#### HAPES STAR CONSORTIUM
Based from the Stronghold of Hapes, the HSC represents over 40 star ststems and maintains a strict isolationist culture. Due to their limited exposure with the rest of the galaxy, their technology is somewhat limited yet powerful enough to suit the Consortium's purposes. Between the nimble Miy'Til, the powerful Hetrinar, and the ultra-elite Hapan Honor Guard, the HSC presents a viable threat if it were to every strike outside its borders...
