Unlike the MC80 however, these vessels can be manufactured at REPUBLIC SHIPYARDS due to the incorporation of commercially-available materials.

Notes: Heavily modified version of the Dreadnaught designed and built with the same principles of Ramano's Heavy Dreadnaught in mind. The onboard ground troops were completely removed in favor of additional starfighters, while the weapons and engine systems were overhauled with the same modifications as the Republic Assault Frigate. The result is a powerful hybrid between the two classes that will no doubt play a role in the Rebel Alliance Fleet, although the extensive modifications to keep the ship in top fighting shape requires routine maintenance. (Usable only by RA players).

If making a run for the planet, enemy forces CAN (and probably will) try to shoot this unit down, if so, be advised of its UCR of 15, as well as the risk of potentially having your Hero Unit killed. If making a run for a Deep Space Zone, please be advised of its x30 Hyperdrive.
